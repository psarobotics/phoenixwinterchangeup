# Code of Conduct

The Robotics Education & Competition Foundation considers the positive, respectful, and ethical conduct of all students, teachers, mentors, parents, and other event attendees an important and essential component of all REC Foundation sanctioned events.

We expect the following behavior and ethical standards at all REC Foundationsanctioned events:

* Act with integrity, honesty, and reliability
* Behave in a respectful and professional manner with eventstaff, volunteers, and fellow competitors
* Exhibit maturity and class when dealing with difficult and stressful situations
* Respect individual differences
* Follow all rules as listed in the current game manual
* Student-centered teams with limited adult assistance
* Safety as a top priority
* Good sportsmanship, which includes supporting your alliance partners

These expectations apply to all team members and all adults associated with a team including, but not limited to, teachers, mentors and parents. This Code may also apply to behavior outside of REC Foundation-sanctioned events where inappropriate actions are
related to an event or participating individuals.

Judges will consider team conduct and ethics when determining awards. Repeated or egregious violations of the expectations in this Code may result in consequences up to the disqualification of the team or organization from the current event and/or future events, and potentially removal from the program after review by the REC Foundation.
